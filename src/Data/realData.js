It (Shamshera) gave me a sense of that. It is a cool film and it is so different,” the actor told PTI. The 32-year-old actor, who starred opposite Hrithik Roshan in 2019’s action drama War, said she is more inclined towards the genre both as an actor and audience.“I love Karan Malhotra’s Agneepath. He knows how much to push each emotion. To be part of a film which is like that and coming from a filmmaker like Karan was icing on the cake,” she added.Shamshera, which was announced in May 2018, features Ranbir, 38, in a never-seen-before avatar. Vaani said her co-actor will surprise the audience with his performance in the film.“The setting of the film is very different. Ranbir has a different look and character in the film. He has pulled it off and how. He will surprise you with this film,” she said.Talking about her role, the Bell Bottom actor said her character goes through a significant evolution in the film.",

It has happened so often in the last seven years that someone might even be deranged enough to recognise a pattern in it. In Ranjit M Tewari’s Bell Bottom, the first big-ticket Hindi film to release since the devastating second-wave of COVID-19 , we hear just another not-nearly-as-subtle-as-the-makers-think version of ‘new India.'The titular spy (played by who else but Akshay Kumar) ends his briefing to his agents with “Ab Hindustan nahi jhukega. Iss baar, unki haar.” This happens after an opening monologue tells us about how the Indo-Pak relations in the early '80s were the best they had ever been, even though there was a sudden emergence of many ‘anti-national’ organisations within India, secretly funded by Pakistan’s ISI.That’s what sets it apart from something like Abhishek Dudhaiya’s Bhuj: The Pride of India that released only a few days ago. While the Ajay Devgn-starrer might beat its chest about what it thinks the audience wants to hear, it is sneaky how the Akshay Kumar-starrer merely suggests it. The Pakistan phobia is not exhibited on a Prabhas-like chest of the “hero”, it is hinted at how a Pakistani president (Kavi Raz) downs his scotch after having 'lost.' The scene will ensure many patriots in the audience have a gotcha smile on their face. It is at a time like this that one really has to determine which one is the 'worse' film — the one that wears its bigotry on its sleeve, or the one that hides it behind the veil of 'entertainment?'",

When I first watched the film as a pre-pubescent, I found Akash funny and Sameer charming, but it was Sid that stayed with me. His sensitivity, gravitas, and deep sense of melancholy resonated with me at an instinctive level. I had not seen anyone like him on screen before. I have not since.When I watched the film again recently, I finally knew why. Today, two decades later, Sameer looks juvenile, and Akash’s humour feels trite. It is only Sid among the trio who has aged well. No, he has gotten better. Without him, Dil Chahta Hai would still have been a breezy coming-of-age story about friendship and love, but it would have lost its soul, its introspective quality that prevents it from being any other forgettable rom-com spun by the dozen every year.",

In him, Hindi cinema got one of its most unforgettable bad boys.The brilliance of Saif’s nuanced performance as Langda Tyagi may not be as surprising for the Netflix audience of today who love him for his portrayal of the complex, conflicted police officer Sartaj Singh in Sacred Games. We have now come to expect him to be experimental. In fact, Saif’s filmography since Omkara has been so diverse and genre-bending, it is almost subversive. He has played them all — from a dog in an animated film (Roadside Romeo), to a terrorist ruined in love (Kurbaan), a bloodthirsty bounty hunter (Laal Kaptaan), Aurangzeb's royal guard (Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior), and a blonde-haired zombie slayer (Go Goa Gone).But 15 years ago, Bhardwaj was shouldering a massive risk in casting Saif as Langda Tyagi. Though Saif had freshly stepped into the grey with Ek Haseena Thi and Being Cyrus, he was still the charming big-ticket multiplex hero known for playing suave and cute in glossy love stories like Hum Tum, Kal Ho Naa Ho, and Dil Chahta Hai. However, with the success Hum Tum and Parineeta, he was finally coming into his own after years of cushioning the performances of lead heroes in quintessential box-office potboilers.",

You know what you're going to be doing.\"To make matters worse, the culture shock that often comes with this transition from military to civilian life is compounded by a communication problem.For instance, many employers outside of the military cannot comprehend the myriad of acronyms soldiers may initially struggle to stop using in their daily work. Some veterans may also struggle to explain how their experience can be applied in a non-military environment.One potential solution comes in an unlikely form: virtual reality (VR).For most people VR is nothing more than a fun gimmick to enhance the experience of playing video games at home however the technology is now starting to be used in some exciting new ways.In Mr Carson's case, he took part in a pilot scheme testing a programme called Artificial Intelligence Designed for Employment (AIDE).

This new character in Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has impressed critics not just for its fresh storyline, but also its brilliant action sequences.Marvel's first martial arts film has been directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and produced by Kevin Feige along with Jonathan Schwartz.The movie features Simu Liu in the title role, Awkwafina, plays his best friend Katy, Fala Chen will be seen as his sister Jiang Li, Tony Leung plays his father Wenwu, and Michelle Yeo as his aunt Ying Nan respectively. Other stars include Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu, Meng’er Zhang, Benedict Wong, Zach Cherry, Dallas Liu, Yuen Wah, and Ronny Chieng.Here are the reviews:Mashable: \“Shang-Chi is a Marvel movie that doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, with a fresh, snappy tone that has a lot in common with 2015's Ant-Man, which also felt like a departure from the franchise formula at the time. Simu Liu is flawless in the role of Shang-Chi. Every choice he makes on-screen builds Shang's character from a hero most people hadn't heard of to an invaluable personality the MCU can bank on for years to come\”.IGN: \“The movie reflects the real-life complicated conflict between first-gen Asian American children and the wishes of their immigrant parents while also serving up the dynamic action scenes that the MCU is known for. Director Destin Daniel Cretton skillfully juggles both of these lofty goals, logging an entry in the Marvel universe that’s both emotionally resonant and delightfully exciting enough to outweigh its occasionally uneven visuals and unfulfilled lore\”.",

You might think so, judging by the long and checkered history of players going Hollywood (not to mention the amount of flopping in today’s game). As the newly released Space Jam: A New Legacy takes the booming subgenre of films built on hoops talent into the era of remakes, here’s a guide to the best and worst performances by pro basketball players, starting in the 1970s.If we are to believe this goofy 1979 movie — and why not? — basketball at the height of disco meant players doing the splits to celebrate buckets, coaching by astrology and Dr J as the coolest man alive. Much of his mellow performance is shot in slow motion, adding to its swagger. In one scene, he seduces a woman by taking her to a playground and dunking in street clothes. In another, he enters a game by hot-air balloon, wearing a glittery silver uniform, backed by funky soul music. If John Travolta had a sports counterpart, this was it.In this easygoing drama about a coach (played by Gabe Kaplan at the height of his Welcome Back, Kotter fame) who builds an underdog college program, New York Knicks star Bernard King delivers an understated, lived-in performance as a pool hustler with a silky jump shot. He keeps up with an ensemble of actors without outshining them too much on the court. Compared with the hectic video-game aesthetic of Space Jam, this character-driven movie feels refreshingly human.There is no more famous jock cameo than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing himself pretending to be an ordinary commercial airplane pilot. The idea that the 7-foot superstar could disguise himself even after being challenged on it by a young fan is one of the countless jokes in this classic comedy. But when his frustration is supposed to turn into anger, Abdul-Jabbar can’t transcend his coolly unflappable stoicism.",

Chased across the galaxy by Imperial forces and bounty hunters, they learn to depend on one other and become a surrogate family you can’t help but root for. No, we aren’t talking about The Mandalorian, but The Bad Batch.The Star Wars animated series comes from Dave Filoni, who was also one of the chief architects behind The Mandalorian. So, some one-dimensional similarities are inevitable. The Bad Batch takes place during the rise of the Galactic Empire, while The Mandalorian takes place after its fall. The series fills in the blanks on a period of uncertainty and upheaval as Palpatine consolidated his power, exploring the finer details of how small reactionary movements slowly emerged on planets tyrannised by the Empire.To establish a clear sense of time, the series is set firmly at the end of the prequels, specifically the end of Revenge of the Sith. The first episode kicks off the very day “Order 66” comes in. The Jedi have been branded as traitors to the Republic and the clones have been ordered to execute them all. Not all clones follow orders to the T. Like the defective troopers of Clone Force 99 aka the Bad Batch, who were introduced in a four-episode run of The Clone Wars’ final season. The “defect” affords them certain exceptional faculties, moral autonomy being one of them. Instead of heeding Palpatine’s injunction, they let a young padawan escape. With the war ended, they begin to question the newly crowned Emperor’s motives, and their own purpose in a galaxy of ever-changing power dynamics.",

        text:"Exhaustion, constant fatigue, irritability, prolonged muscle soreness, and fitness plateaus can all be signs you’re overdoing your workouts.Jovo Jovanovic/StocksyWe all know that moving our bodies is good for us. Exercise benefits heart health, bone health, weight control, mood and emotional health, and much more.Current guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend adults get 150 to 300 minutes of moderate physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity each week, in addition to strength training.And many endurance and professional athletes safely perform many more hours of physical activity per week than the guidelines set as the minimum.There is controversy, however, among sport medicine researchers if there is even a point at which too much exercise ever becomes harmful in ultra-endurance athletes, according to a review published in 2019 in the journal AIMS Public Health. Other research suggests though that there is no upper limit for healthy adults in terms of how much aerobic activity benefits the heart.But it’s important to point out that the guidelines also mention that there’s no specific upper limit when exercise benefits cease to exist. And the guidelines don’t specify if there’s an upper limit when larger amounts of exercise are unsafe.And while not getting enough exercise is the bigger issue for most Americans (a group of cardiologists wrote a review on the topic in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology in January 2016), exercising too much can be a problem, too.",

In 2016 in Rio, we learned about cupping. In 2012 in London, we learned about kinesio tape.At the Tokyo Olympics, the new trend is blood flow restriction (BFR) training. The American swimmer Michael Andrew and the American marathon runner Galen Rupp have both been spotted with tourniquet-like bands on their limbs used for BFR, The New York Times reported July 21.BFR training is a technique in which pressurized bands (which look similar to blood pressure cuffs) are worn around the arms or legs to slow blood flow to specific muscles during training. It's thought to trigger the body to build more muscle mass than it otherwise would at that training intensity.During BRF training, periods of blood flow restriction are paired with periods of rest during which blood flow is restored to the area, explains Elizabeth C. Gardner, MD, an orthopedic sports medicine surgeon at Yale Medicine and the head team orthopedic surgeon at Yale University Athletics in New Haven, Connecticut. \“This allows the involved musclesto reap the benefits of much higher intensity training, while protecting the injured limb from higher stresses.\”And while it may be getting more attention thanks to this year’s Olympic Games, the technique itself is not brand-new. Yoshiaki Sato, MD, PhD, is widely credited with developing BRF for muscle training and injury recovery in the 1960s in Japan. He patented his version of the training technique in the 1990s under the brand Kaatsu (now a company that makes its own BRF devices and offers training programs).",

Well, studies show that strength training can provide all those benefits and more.Strength training — also known as weight or resistance training — is physical activity designed to improve muscular strength and fitness by exercising a specific muscle or muscle group against external resistance, including free-weights, weight machines, or your own body weight, according to the American Heart Association.right up arrow\“The basic principle is to apply a load and overload the muscle so it needs to adapt and get stronger,\” explains Neal Pire, CSCS, an ACSM-certified exercise physiologist and account manager at The Gym at Englewood in Englewood, New Jersey.And what’s important for everyone to know is that strength training is not just about body builders lifting weights in a gym. Regular strength or resistance training is good for people of all ages and fitness levels to help prevent the natural loss of lean muscle mass that comes with aging (the medical term for this loss is sarcopenia). It can also benefit people with chronic health conditions, like obesity, arthritis, or a heart condition.",

        text:"To become stronger, faster, and fitter, you have to push your body harder. But then you have to rest, too.All workouts, especially tough ones, stress the body. You’re fatiguing, or tiring out, various muscles when you work out, which means you’re causing microscopic damage to muscle cells. Hormone and enzyme levels fluctuate, and inflammation actually increases, explains Chris Kolba, PhD, a physical therapist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. The changes you’re causing can do your body a lot of good. They lead to muscle growth, fat loss, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, better cardiovascular health, and overall healthier bodies. But you need to give your body time for those good changes to happen before you start stressing it out again.\“This rest, called exercise recovery, is what allows people to [benefit] from their workouts,\” Dr. Kolba says, allowing you to get the maximum benefit from every exercise session.The damage that exercise causes triggers your body’s immune system to repair that damage, explains Adam Rivadeneyra, MD, a sports medicine physician with the Hoag Orthopedic Institute and the Orthopaedic Specialty Institute in Orange, California. And when your body’s tissues — from your muscles and bones to heart and lungs — recover, they become slightly fitter than they were before. That way, the next time you perform the same workout, you won’t suffer as much damage.\“But you have to cause some damage to your body for it to adapt,\” Dr. Rivadeneyra says.Repeated again and again, this process of stress and recovery is what results in improved health and fitness.",

Sure, exercise can improve your physical health and your physique, trim your waistline, improve your sex life, and even add years to your life. But that’s not what motivates most people to stay active.People who exercise regularly tend to do so because it gives them an enormous sense of well-being. They feel more energetic throughout the day, sleep better at night, have sharper memories, and feel more relaxed and positive about themselves and their lives. And it’s also a powerful medicine for many common mental health challenges.Regular exercise can have a profoundly positive impact on depression, anxiety, and ADHD. It also relieves stress, improves memory, helps you sleep better, and boosts your overall mood. And you don’t have to be a fitness fanatic to reap the benefits. Research indicates that modest amounts of exercise can make a real difference. No matter your age or fitness level, you can learn to use exercise as a powerful tool to deal with mental health problems, improve your energy and outlook, and get more out of life.Studies show that exercise can treat mild to moderate depression as effectively as antidepressant medication—but without the side-effects, of course. As one example, a recent study done by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that running for 15 minutes a day or walking for an hour reduces the risk of major depression by 26%. In addition to relieving depression symptoms, research also shows that maintaining an exercise schedule can prevent you from relapsing.Exercise is a powerful depression fighter for several reasons. Most importantly, it promotes all kinds of changes in the brain, including neural growth, reduced inflammation, and new activity patterns that promote feelings of calm and well-being. It also releases endorphins, powerful chemicals in your brain that energize your spirits and make you feel good. Finally, exercise can also serve as a distraction, allowing you to find some quiet time to break out of the cycle of negative thoughts that feed depression.",

This allows many unhealthy products to claim that they are \“healthy\”.In one study, researchers followed more than 16,000 middle-aged men from around the world for 25 years. The higher the consumption of beans, the lower the risk of death from heart disease — up to 82% reduction in risk! Dietary fiber from whole grains seems to also have a strong protective effect against cardiovascular diseases.In randomized controlled trials, compared to baseline values, vegetarian diets with additional fiber, soy, and nuts were associated with a 20% decrease in total cholesterol and a 35% decrease in LDL cholesterol.Without adequate stool bulk, the colon will panic and respond with excessive contractions. This leads to the creation of diverticula, which are herniations of the mucosal layer through weak colon muscles (essentially little inflamed intestinal pouches). Consuming sufficient fiber can prevent this.",

Shred them over some creamy kheer, toast them to make a soft and air-light souffle or grind them to make some luscious Badaami Korma - they're one of the most commonly found and loved nuts.Almonds grow on trees in a pale green perforated shell. When an almond is attached to the tree, it is known as drupe. But almonds aren't the only ones that grow in a shell - Olives, prunes and apricots also grow in a hard casing and are found on trees.Some believe that almonds have been around for almost 19,000 years.They were initially cultivated in Iran, Afghanistan and Turkey, and later spread out to the Mediterranean region, Europe and China. Almonds also have great historical significance. It is said that almond and almond trees both featured in the Old Testament. The branch of the almond tree was also spoken of in Exodus, the story of Moses and in Egypt they were stuffed in all kinds of treasures - vases, boxes, jewelry cases etc.If your mother pleaded with you every morning to eat your daily dose of soaked almonds, then she may have been right. Choosing between soaked almonds and raw almonds isn't just a matter of taste, it's about picking the healthier option.   Why soaked almonds are better - Firstly, the brown peel of almonds contains tannin which inhibits nutrient absorption. Once you soak almonds the peel comes off easily and allows the nut to release all nutrients easily.How to soak? Soak a handful of almonds in half a cup of water. Cover them and allow them to soak for 8 hours. Drain the water, peel off the skin and store them in plastic container. These soaked almonds will last you for about a week.",

Experts seem to agree that if you need some help with hair fall and want to grow your hair, there is nothing like a regular dose of flaxseeds. Initially, I had a little difficulty in cultivating taste for it in its raw form, but my love for it grew after a while. You don't really need to load up on flaxseeds, a little helping is enough. Experts and nutritionists recommend a tablespoon of flaxseeds a day to meet your essential, daily nutritional requirement. However, you need to be watchful of the way you consume flaxseeds. Flaxseeds are brown in colour and come with a hard, crunchy covering. Flaxseeds, if not chewed properly would render no benefit to your body, this is one of the biggest reasons why many like to soak it before consuming or simply have it in the ground or powdered form. The benefits of flaxseeds are in abundance.Flaxseeds are enriched with some of the most essential and basic nutrients that our body requires. These come enriched with fibre, protein, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous, lignan among other nutrients and minerals. Lignans present in them help in battling high levels of estrogen and help in maintaining balanced hormonal levels. Since flaxseeds are energy-dense with great satiety value, these make you feel full and therefore facilitate weight management. Flaxseeds are great for women's health, regular consumption may help reduce menopausal symptomsand can also help tackling irregular periods and menstruation-linked discomfort. Women should make the best out of these alsi seeds benefits.There has been quite a lot of debate on how should one consume flaxseeds. It is true that flaxseeds, when not chewed properly, can go undigested, flushed out your system. Ground or milled flaxseeds, in that case, make a better choice. You can also opt for flaxseed oil to replace other oils in your cooking. We share with you, some of the easiest ways in which you can incorporate flaxseeds in your daily diet.\"If you buy whole flaxseeds, grind as needed and add to yogurt, oatmeal, cereal, smoothies, casseroles, and baked goods. Sprouting flaxseeds releases more of their protein and omega-3 fats,\" as mentioned in Healing Foods.",

The nut and the fruit, both have multiple uses. The nut, often known as the poor man’s plantation although now it is sold for steep prices, is used to make delectable and rich curries and also roasted and eaten dry. They are an intrinsic part of our festive celebrations too. Just imagine how incomplete Diwali celebrations would be without 'kaju ki barfi'. Back when nomads had no idea how to consume the fruit, the nut was discarded while the fruit was given more importance.

Besides its unique flavour and fragrance, guava has been hailed as one of the super fruits due to the numerous health benefits it offers. It indeed is a powerhouse of nutrients. “This humble fruit is extraordinarily rich in vitamin C, lycopene and antioxidants that are beneficial for skin. Guavas are also rich in manganese which helps the body to absorb other key nutrients from the food that we eat. Guavas benefits are credited due to the presence of folate, a mineral which helps promote fertility. The potassium in guavas helps normalise blood pressure levels as well.

In another case, the photo on the oil bottle shows peanuts and it says peanut oil, and then in a small font in a corner it says that it has sunflower oil too. It's all becoming utterly confusing and with newer oils slipping onto grocery shelves, how on earth does one decide what to pick up.In India, since time immemorial, the oil you use in your kitchen is largely dependent on where you come from. In Kerala, it's coconut oil, in Andhra and Rajasthan, it's sesame oil, in the east and north they use mustard oil and in central India and Gujarat groundnut oil is used. Different cultures eat differently and the type of oil fits beautifully into the food landscape of that region.But all that changed in the 80's with the scare of cholesterol and heart disease. Overnight ghee got a bad name and we were told that we should avoid trans-fats and sunflower oil became popular. That was in the 90's.But today it's an altogether different story. You have new types of oil spilling across the grocery shelves from around the world and each new bottle label brings with it a new health hope.One of the most important things to keep in mind is - that oil behaves differently when heated, it changes texture, color, taste as well as it's nutritional properties. When the oil reaches its smoking point, a lot of the nutrients are destroyed and it can sometimes potentially form harmful compounds. Also, different oils have varying amounts of fats - Polyunsaturated, Monounsaturated and Saturated fats.When I asked India's leading nutritionist, Dr. Shikha Sharma how much oil should we consume, she said that the total quantity of oil consumption should not cross 2 teaspoons per person per day. That's as far as quantity goes, but what about the quality. Here's a look at various oils and why they are not created equal.",

Scroll down for the powerful health benefits and beauty benefits of Ashwagandha. Ashwagandha, the magical herb, is considered to be nature's gift to mankind. For centuries, Ayurvedic medicine has used it to treat people for their day to day woes such as stress, anxiety, exhaustion, lack of sleep et al. And with an abundance of antioxidants, iron and amino acids, it's no surprise that Ashwagandha is one of the most powerful herbs in Ayurvedic healing. It is classified as a rasayana i.e. rejuvenation in Ayurveda and expected to promote physical and mental health, restore the body and increase longevity. It has been glorified over time for its dual capacity to energise and calm at the same time.But what exactly is Ashwagandha? The Sanskrit term Ashwagandha translates to \"smell of horse\", and rightly so. Traditionally, it is believed that a person who consumes this herbal medicine will gain horse-like strength and vitality. It is a small shrub with yellow flowers and a red fruit, native to India, North Africa, and the Middle East. The extract is typically taken from the berries or roots of the plant. It is also referred to as Withania Somnifera (Latin name), Indian Ginseng or Winter Cherry.Dr Ashutosh Gautam, Clinical Operations and Coordination Manager at Baidyanath says, \"Ashwagandha can be taken in the form of powder or tablet. For added benefit, it can also be put in to Kashmiri Kahwa. It has hormone balancing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties which can prevent and treat a number of diseases. Ashwagandha is popularly used for boosting immunity, anti-ageing, joint pain and insomnia. Due to its active ingredient called withanolides, Ashwagandha is also used as an \"adaptogen\" to help the body cope with daily stress, as a general tonic and for improving thinking ability. It also improves the brain's memory functions like attention and concentration, hence helping with the symptoms of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. It enables the body to reserve and sustain vital energy throughout the day while promoting sound, peaceful sleep at night.\" These varied benefits are what makes Ashwagandha a go-to choice in Indian herbal medicine.",
