        title:"The Best Cooking Oils for Your Health",
        text:"I have heard of blended whiskeys. But this was the first time I was hearing of blended oils.The packet claimed that it's an olive oil and then when I looked closely, it read blended oil. In another case, the photo on the oil bottle shows peanuts and it says peanut oil, and then in a small font in a corner it says that it has sunflower oil too. It's all becoming utterly confusing and with newer oils slipping onto grocery shelves, how on earth does one decide what to pick up.In India, since time immemorial, the oil you use in your kitchen is largely dependent on where you come from. In Kerala, it's coconut oil, in Andhra and Rajasthan, it's sesame oil, in the east and north they use mustard oil and in central India and Gujarat groundnut oil is used. Different cultures eat differently and the type of oil fits beautifully into the food landscape of that region.But all that changed in the 80's with the scare of cholesterol and heart disease. Overnight ghee got a bad name and we were told that we should avoid trans-fats and sunflower oil became popular. That was in the 90's.But today it's an altogether different story. You have new types of oil spilling across the grocery shelves from around the world and each new bottle label brings with it a new health hope.One of the most important things to keep in mind is - that oil behaves differently when heated, it changes texture, color, taste as well as it's nutritional properties. When the oil reaches its smoking point, a lot of the nutrients are destroyed and it can sometimes potentially form harmful compounds. Also, different oils have varying amounts of fats - Polyunsaturated, Monounsaturated and Saturated fats.When I asked India's leading nutritionist, Dr. Shikha Sharma how much oil should we consume, she said that the total quantity of oil consumption should not cross 2 teaspoons per person per day. That's as far as quantity goes, but what about the quality. Here's a look at various oils and why they are not created equal.",

        title:"Ashwagandha: It's Powerful Health and Beauty Benefits",
        text:"Want to look younger, feel healthier, sleep better? Ashwagandha, the miraculous herb is just the ticket for you. Scroll down for the powerful health benefits and beauty benefits of Ashwagandha. Ashwagandha, the magical herb, is considered to be nature's gift to mankind. For centuries, Ayurvedic medicine has used it to treat people for their day to day woes such as stress, anxiety, exhaustion, lack of sleep et al. And with an abundance of antioxidants, iron and amino acids, it's no surprise that Ashwagandha is one of the most powerful herbs in Ayurvedic healing. It is classified as a rasayana i.e. rejuvenation in Ayurveda and expected to promote physical and mental health, restore the body and increase longevity. It has been glorified over time for its dual capacity to energise and calm at the same time.But what exactly is Ashwagandha? The Sanskrit term Ashwagandha translates to \"smell of horse\", and rightly so. Traditionally, it is believed that a person who consumes this herbal medicine will gain horse-like strength and vitality. It is a small shrub with yellow flowers and a red fruit, native to India, North Africa, and the Middle East. The extract is typically taken from the berries or roots of the plant. It is also referred to as Withania Somnifera (Latin name), Indian Ginseng or Winter Cherry.Dr Ashutosh Gautam, Clinical Operations and Coordination Manager at Baidyanath says, \"Ashwagandha can be taken in the form of powder or tablet. For added benefit, it can also be put in to Kashmiri Kahwa. It has hormone balancing, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant properties which can prevent and treat a number of diseases. Ashwagandha is popularly used for boosting immunity, anti-ageing, joint pain and insomnia. Due to its active ingredient called withanolides, Ashwagandha is also used as an \"adaptogen\" to help the body cope with daily stress, as a general tonic and for improving thinking ability. It also improves the brain's memory functions like attention and concentration, hence helping with the symptoms of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. It enables the body to reserve and sustain vital energy throughout the day while promoting sound, peaceful sleep at night.\" These varied benefits are what makes Ashwagandha a go-to choice in Indian herbal medicine.",

        title:"‘Palaharam’ packs for Onam turn hot sellers",
        text:"Onam is an emotion. It translates into flowers, food, families, clothes, swings, songs, films, nostalgia, vacations, and more. A festival celebrated by every Malayali.For Onam 2021, Ajish Jayachandran, CEO of Tastetre, and Smitha Prasad, director, creative and corporate communications of Citrine Hospitality Group, decided to recreate a slice of their childhood by selling a bouquet of traditional, ethnic snacks for Onam that used to be made at every home during the festival season.So, for Onam, she decided to revive the tradition this year through their enterprise. They sought the help of a couple of senior citizens and Geethakumari to make the palaharam. Made in coconut oil, one ‘regular’ Onam palahara kutta (wicker basket) has five achappam, 10 alanga, two madakasan, three vettu cake, five each of kuzhalappam, masala murukku and ari murukku, six mundirikothu and five ari unda for ₹599. Unniyappam and neyyappam come for an additional ₹150. The ‘jumbo kutta’ has the same snacks but twice the number of each.The snack basket was initially meant only for Thiruvananthapuram. “We have been getting requests from NRIs who want to send a basket for their parents and grandparents. Now the basket is sent all across India,” says Smitha.She feels that a new generation of children would have no idea of the ethnic palaharam as many are used to eating packaged snacks. She hopes the Onam hamper inspires some of them to explore the traditional eats that were once a must for Onam.",
