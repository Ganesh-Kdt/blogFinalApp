        title:"Incredible Cashew Nut Benefits",
        text:"A popular ingredient finding its way into many Indian gravies, cashew - a plant originating from Brazil, is a nut high in minerals. Brought to India by traders, the cashew tree grows up to exceptional heights having a rather irregular trunk. Hanging from the branches are large juicy apples at the bottom of which are attached the cashew nut. Made available round the year, the nut has a great shelf life if stored properly. The nut and the fruit, both have multiple uses. The nut, often known as the poor man’s plantation although now it is sold for steep prices, is used to make delectable and rich curries and also roasted and eaten dry. They are an intrinsic part of our festive celebrations too. Just imagine how incomplete Diwali celebrations would be without 'kaju ki barfi'. Back when nomads had no idea how to consume the fruit, the nut was discarded while the fruit was given more importance. A book written by SP Malhotra, World Edible Nuts Economy, points out, \"Natives also knew of many medicinal uses for the apple juice, bark and caustic seed oil that were later exploited by the Europeans.\” ",

        title:"All About Fiber",
        text:"We can divide fiber into two general categories, based on their structure and what they do in our bodies.Soluble fibers are viscous and fermentable, and can lower our blood cholesterol.Insoluble fibers help to bulk up stool volume and improve motility.We need both types of fiber in our diets.However, since we live in a world of refined and fortified foods, there are now “functional dietary fibers.” These are the isolated, non-digestible carbohydrates that fortify foods not usually containing fiber — stuff like \“fiber-ed up\” Splenda and Apple Jacks. This allows many unhealthy products to claim that they are \“healthy\”.In one study, researchers followed more than 16,000 middle-aged men from around the world for 25 years. The higher the consumption of beans, the lower the risk of death from heart disease — up to 82% reduction in risk! Dietary fiber from whole grains seems to also have a strong protective effect against cardiovascular diseases.In randomized controlled trials, compared to baseline values, vegetarian diets with additional fiber, soy, and nuts were associated with a 20% decrease in total cholesterol and a 35% decrease in LDL cholesterol.Without adequate stool bulk, the colon will panic and respond with excessive contractions. This leads to the creation of diverticula, which are herniations of the mucosal layer through weak colon muscles (essentially little inflamed intestinal pouches). Consuming sufficient fiber can prevent this.",

        title:"Dil Chahta Hai turns 20",
        text:"Men like Siddharth Sinha are rare. Both in real life and in films. In an industry that loves to obsess over and glorify the man-child, men like Sid come once in a generation.It has been 20 years since Dil Chahta Hai released but I still cannot think of any other character in movies that has been written and performed with as much care and control. When I first watched the film as a pre-pubescent, I found Akash funny and Sameer charming, but it was Sid that stayed with me. His sensitivity, gravitas, and deep sense of melancholy resonated with me at an instinctive level. I had not seen anyone like him on screen before. I have not since.When I watched the film again recently, I finally knew why. Today, two decades later, Sameer looks juvenile, and Akash’s humour feels trite. It is only Sid among the trio who has aged well. No, he has gotten better. Without him, Dil Chahta Hai would still have been a breezy coming-of-age story about friendship and love, but it would have lost its soul, its introspective quality that prevents it from being any other forgettable rom-com spun by the dozen every year.",
