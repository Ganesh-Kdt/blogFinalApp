        text:"Does every NBA superstar really want to be in movies? You might think so, judging by the long and checkered history of players going Hollywood (not to mention the amount of flopping in today’s game). As the newly released Space Jam: A New Legacy takes the booming subgenre of films built on hoops talent into the era of remakes, here’s a guide to the best and worst performances by pro basketball players, starting in the 1970s.If we are to believe this goofy 1979 movie — and why not? — basketball at the height of disco meant players doing the splits to celebrate buckets, coaching by astrology and Dr J as the coolest man alive. Much of his mellow performance is shot in slow motion, adding to its swagger. In one scene, he seduces a woman by taking her to a playground and dunking in street clothes. In another, he enters a game by hot-air balloon, wearing a glittery silver uniform, backed by funky soul music. If John Travolta had a sports counterpart, this was it.In this easygoing drama about a coach (played by Gabe Kaplan at the height of his Welcome Back, Kotter fame) who builds an underdog college program, New York Knicks star Bernard King delivers an understated, lived-in performance as a pool hustler with a silky jump shot. He keeps up with an ensemble of actors without outshining them too much on the court. Compared with the hectic video-game aesthetic of Space Jam, this character-driven movie feels refreshingly human.There is no more famous jock cameo than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar playing himself pretending to be an ordinary commercial airplane pilot. The idea that the 7-foot superstar could disguise himself even after being challenged on it by a young fan is one of the countless jokes in this classic comedy. But when his frustration is supposed to turn into anger, Abdul-Jabbar can’t transcend his coolly unflappable stoicism.",

Kit Harington plays Dane Whitman.Anthony Mackie closes deal to lead Captain America 4Anthony Mackie has officially come aboard Captain America 4 at Marvel Studios. Mackie, who plays Sam Wilson aka The Falcon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), recently assumed the title of Captain America towards the end of his Disney Plus series Falcon and The Winter Soldier.According to Deadline, Mackie has closed a deal to star in Captain America 4, which will see Wilson wield Captain America's shield on the big screen for the first time.Malcolm Spellman is writing the script with Dalan Musson, who worked with him on The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige will produce the superhero movie, which does not have a director attached as of yet. Chris Evans played Captain America through his Steve Rogers’ character in all the three earlier films -- Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America: Civil War (2016) -- as well as four Avengers movies. But at the end of 2019's Avengers: Endgame, Rogers retired and handed his shield to Mackie’s Sam Wilson, whose story is mapped in Falcon and The Winter Soldier along with Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes/ Winter Soldier.",

        text:"A motley crew of mercenaries with an aversion to following orders become unlikely guardians of a mysterious child. Chased across the galaxy by Imperial forces and bounty hunters, they learn to depend on one other and become a surrogate family you can’t help but root for. No, we aren’t talking about The Mandalorian, but The Bad Batch.The Star Wars animated series comes from Dave Filoni, who was also one of the chief architects behind The Mandalorian. So, some one-dimensional similarities are inevitable. The Bad Batch takes place during the rise of the Galactic Empire, while The Mandalorian takes place after its fall. The series fills in the blanks on a period of uncertainty and upheaval as Palpatine consolidated his power, exploring the finer details of how small reactionary movements slowly emerged on planets tyrannised by the Empire.To establish a clear sense of time, the series is set firmly at the end of the prequels, specifically the end of Revenge of the Sith. The first episode kicks off the very day “Order 66” comes in. The Jedi have been branded as traitors to the Republic and the clones have been ordered to execute them all. Not all clones follow orders to the T. Like the defective troopers of Clone Force 99 aka the Bad Batch, who were introduced in a four-episode run of The Clone Wars’ final season. The “defect” affords them certain exceptional faculties, moral autonomy being one of them. Instead of heeding Palpatine’s injunction, they let a young padawan escape. With the war ended, they begin to question the newly crowned Emperor’s motives, and their own purpose in a galaxy of ever-changing power dynamics.",
