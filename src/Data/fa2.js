        title:"Shang Chi and the Legend of The Ten Rings review round-up",
        text:"The hype around the new Marvel film Shang Chi and the Legend of The Ten Rings is mounting, especially after rave reviews from critics. This new character in Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) has impressed critics not just for its fresh storyline, but also its brilliant action sequences.Marvel's first martial arts film has been directed by Destin Daniel Cretton and produced by Kevin Feige along with Jonathan Schwartz.The movie features Simu Liu in the title role, Awkwafina, plays his best friend Katy, Fala Chen will be seen as his sister Jiang Li, Tony Leung plays his father Wenwu, and Michelle Yeo as his aunt Ying Nan respectively. Other stars include Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu, Meng’er Zhang, Benedict Wong, Zach Cherry, Dallas Liu, Yuen Wah, and Ronny Chieng.Here are the reviews:Mashable: \“Shang-Chi is a Marvel movie that doesn't feel like a Marvel movie, with a fresh, snappy tone that has a lot in common with 2015's Ant-Man, which also felt like a departure from the franchise formula at the time. Simu Liu is flawless in the role of Shang-Chi. Every choice he makes on-screen builds Shang's character from a hero most people hadn't heard of to an invaluable personality the MCU can bank on for years to come\”.IGN: \“The movie reflects the real-life complicated conflict between first-gen Asian American children and the wishes of their immigrant parents while also serving up the dynamic action scenes that the MCU is known for. Director Destin Daniel Cretton skillfully juggles both of these lofty goals, logging an entry in the Marvel universe that’s both emotionally resonant and delightfully exciting enough to outweigh its occasionally uneven visuals and unfulfilled lore\”.",

        title:"Post-Workout Muscle Recovery",
        text:"To become stronger, faster, and fitter, you have to push your body harder. But then you have to rest, too.All workouts, especially tough ones, stress the body. You’re fatiguing, or tiring out, various muscles when you work out, which means you’re causing microscopic damage to muscle cells. Hormone and enzyme levels fluctuate, and inflammation actually increases, explains Chris Kolba, PhD, a physical therapist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. The changes you’re causing can do your body a lot of good. They lead to muscle growth, fat loss, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced inflammation, better cardiovascular health, and overall healthier bodies. But you need to give your body time for those good changes to happen before you start stressing it out again.\“This rest, called exercise recovery, is what allows people to [benefit] from their workouts,\” Dr. Kolba says, allowing you to get the maximum benefit from every exercise session.The damage that exercise causes triggers your body’s immune system to repair that damage, explains Adam Rivadeneyra, MD, a sports medicine physician with the Hoag Orthopedic Institute and the Orthopaedic Specialty Institute in Orange, California. And when your body’s tissues — from your muscles and bones to heart and lungs — recover, they become slightly fitter than they were before. That way, the next time you perform the same workout, you won’t suffer as much damage.\“But you have to cause some damage to your body for it to adapt,\” Dr. Rivadeneyra says.Repeated again and again, this process of stress and recovery is what results in improved health and fitness.",
